# Curly Java

A simple, interactive console-based Java calculator that performs basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and advanced operations like power, square root, and factorials.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- **Advanced Operations**:
  - Power (`a^b`).
  - Square Root (`√a`).
  - Factorial (`a!`).
- **Error Handling**:
  - Division by zero.
  - Factorial and square root validation for negative numbers.
- **Interactive Menu**:
  - Simple text-based menu with options to perform calculations and exit the program.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kinanix7/curly-Java.git
   ```
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

## Menu Options

After running the program, select an option from the menu:

1. **Addition**: Add two numbers.
2. **Subtraction**: Subtract the second number from the first.
3. **Multiplication**: Multiply two numbers.
4. **Division**: Divide the first number by the second.
5. **Power**: Raise the first number to the power of the second.
6. **Square Root**: Compute the square root of a number.
7. **Factorial**: Calculate the factorial of a number.
8. **Quit**: Exit the program.
